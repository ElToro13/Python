Kedar Jadhav, right handed bat, comes to the crease
 
46.5 Southee to Dhoni, FOUR, lovely from Dhoni, just sheer power and nothing else, short of a good length and on the stumps, Dhoni swivels across and clubs it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes
 
46.6 Southee to Dhoni, leg byes, 1 run, good comeback from Southee, the slower ball on Dhoni's pads as he came down the track, he was looking to nudge it towards the on-side and missed, sneaks in a leg bye
 
This is the highest total in 15 ODIs in Kanpur. Previous: 303 by SA vs Ind, 2015
 
47.1 Boult to Dhoni, 1 run, Boult has been very good with his yorkers, another wide yorker outside off, Dhoni jams it out towards long-off. There's a slight fumble, but Kedar Jadhav was slow on the first run and can't come back
 
47.2 Boult to Kedar Jadhav, 1 run, that's innovative from Kedar, shuffles across his stumps, gets down on his knees and sweeps a very full ball towards deep mid-wicket
 
47.3 Boult to Dhoni, 1 run, high full-toss outside off, slugged away towards long-on for a single
 
Back to over the wicket..
 
47.4 Boult to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, that's the risk with this angle, this was a wide full-toss, Kedar had to reach out for the shot, gets enough bat to clear backward point and rolls away to the ropes
 
Back to round the wicket
